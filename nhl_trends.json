Betting Trends?\n\nResearch is vital to sports bettors, especially in the NHL – although the past won’t dictate the future, it will give you a ton of context that can shape the kinds of wagers you make. \n\nThe reality is that from time to time, you just won’t feel like diving into the world of stats – even bettors need a healthy scratch now and then! That’s where NHL trends are the perfect middle ground.\n\nWhether they’re recent patterns or something that has been building over the past few seasons, all you need is your best judgment and you’ll have made an informed bet. Helpful trends to look out for include:\n\nHow often does a team cover the puckline at home versus the road?\nHow do Eastern Conference teams fare against the Western teams?\nHow does a team do when coming off a loss?\nHistorically, does one team dominate another in their matchup?\n\nAnd the list goes on. With so many NHL odds at play, from the regular season schedule to the Stanley Cup, these patterns and trends can grow into an extremely useful tool for sports bettors.\n\nUpcoming Events\nScores & Schedule\nNFL\nNCAAF\nNBA\nNCAAB\nNHL\nUFC\nCFL\nToday \n7:00 PM EST\nMNMT\nANA\nWAS\n+110\n-135\n41%\n59%\n6.5\n7:00 PM EST\nUT16\nUTA\nNYR\n-110\n-110\n41%\n59%\n5.5\n7:30 PM EST\nAMZN\nDET\nOTT\n+130\n-150\n43%\n57%\n6\n9:30 PM EST\nKHN\nSEA\nCAL\n+120\n-140\n75%\n25%\n5.5\n10:30 PM EST\nFDW\nMIN\nLA\n-120\n+100\n63%\n37%\n5.5\nSee More\n\n[banner_bet99:BET99-2374158-sticky]\n\nOddsShark NHL NHL Betting Trends - December, 2025\nAS SEEN ON\nSports\nNFL\nNBA\nMLB\nNHL\nWNBA\nNCAAF\nNCAAB\nUFC\nTools\nParlay Calculator\nOdds Calculator\nHedge Calculator\nHold Calculator\nReviews\nBest Online Sportsbooks\nBest Online Casinos\nSweepstakes Reviews\nPrediction Market Reviews\nDFS Reviews\nPromos\nSportsbook Promos\nCasino Promos\nSweepstakes Promos\nAbout\nContact\nAbout Us\nAuthors\nTerms\nRSS\nLegal\nUSA\nCanada\n\nFooter: Menu\n\nResponsible Gaming\nContact\nAbout Us\nTerms\nRSS\n21+\n\nThe handicapping, sports odds information contained on this website is for entertainment purposes only.

of context that can shape the kinds of wagers you make. \n\nThe reality is that from time to time, you just won’t feel like diving into the world of stats – even bettors need a healthy scratch now and then! That’s where NHL trends are the perfect middle ground.\n\nWhether they’re recent patterns or something that has been building over the past few seasons, all you need is your best judgment and you’ll have made an informed bet. Helpful trends to look out for include:\n\nHow often does a team cover the puckline at home versus the road?\nHow do Eastern Conference teams fare against the Western teams?\nHow does a team do when coming off a loss?\nHistorically, does one team dominate another in their matchup?\n\nAnd the list goes on. With so many NHL odds at play, from the regular season schedule to the Stanley Cup, these patterns and trends can grow into an extremely useful tool for sports bettors.\n\nUpcoming Events\nScores & Schedule\nNFL\nNCAAF\nNBA\nNCAAB\nNHL\nUFC\nCFL\nToday \n7:00 PM EST\nMNMT\nANA\nWAS\n+110\n-135\n41%\n59%\n6.5\n7:00 PM EST\nUT16\nUTA\nNYR\n-110\n-110\n41%\n59%\n5.5\n7:30 PM EST\nAMZN\nDET\nOTT\n+130\n-150\n43%\n57%\n6\n9:30 PM EST\nKHN\nSEA\nCAL\n+120\n-140\n75%\n25%\n5.5\n10:30 PM EST\nFDW\nMIN\nLA\n-120\n+100\n63%\n37%\n5.5\nSee More\n\n[banner_bet99:BET99-2374158-sticky]",
